# Maze-Game
A maze game where one drags tiles to recreate a correct maze

Original idea and project specifications by Dr. Kim Buckner, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Wyoming.

Project created in collaboration with Chandler Haukap, Spencer Hedeen and Batyr Nuryyev.

The game begines by loading a maze in a proprietary .mze format. That file corresponds with tiles that are creates for the screen. The user can left click on a tile and then left click on an empty space where the user wants the tile to be placed. The user can right click a tile to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. Once the tiles are placed in a correct order, then the user wins and a display message states appears that displays the time it took.
